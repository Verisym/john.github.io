<h1>Data Privacy in Social Media</h1>

<p>Social media is a collection of websites and applications that allow users to share and create content. Since its spike in popularity in the early two-thousands, 
	it has changed the way we connect and communicate. This unprecedented growth has created gaps in online data privacy laws in countries around the world with 
	governments struggling to keep up. This allows multi-national companies to mismanage many people’s data as they see fit. We plan to investigate the good side of 
	social media data mining and its misuse by companies who encourage users to overshare data and allow it to be exploited. As well as corporations magnifying the 
	issues of malware sharing and its contribution to identity theft. </p>

<p>Social media data is characterized as the information gathered from social networks that show how users share, view, or interact with each other using the social 
	networks' content, text messaging, or profile data. Social media data is a powerful way in which people can easily view what the public says or does (Kennedy & Moss, 2015). 
	Some examples of social media data include but are not limited to shares, likes, impressions, mentions, hashtags, URL clicks, followers, keywords, and comments. 
	These can be used to decide on various social strategy actions by the user. It has been used in research for the betterment of society, but also by large corporations 
	and government entities, that use data monitoring - Resulting in reduced user privacy (Kennedy & Moss, 2015). </p>

<p>Several companies have violated the privacy of social media users since the invention of social media. Big data mining companies have been scouring social media 
	sites for information about individuals to use in targeted advertisements. Cambridge Analytica is an example of a data mining company that has been mining 
	social media data for political advertisements (Criddle, 2020). This company obtains an individual's social media information, including public posts, and analyses it 
	for use in targeted advertising (Criddle, 2020). Individual privacy is important and should never be violated, no matter how minor it appears. These reasons outline 
	why social media privacy is important and should not be taken lightly. </p>

<p>Data mining is the process routinely used by large companies to turn data from individuals into information that is deemed useful (Alexandra Twin, 2021). 
	Businesses use data mining to obtain trends and patterns, which are analysed, so they can learn what their customers are interested in. The information data scientists 
	gather is used in creating marketing plans to effectively reach new customers for their respective products or services or gratify existing ones. The issue stems from 
	mega corporations collecting data from unaware users. This results in a violation of the user's privacy and is subject to monitoring by mega-corporations such as Facebook 
	along with government agencies alike. The process of data mining is typically done by data scientists, business intelligence people, and analytics professionals (Craig Stedman, 2021). 
	Moreover, data mining involves the use of machine learning and statistical analysis. </p>

<p>According to Craig Stedman (2021), data mining involves four stages, data gathering, data preparation, mining the data, and data analysis and interpretation. The first step in 
	data mining is gathering the relevant data. This can be found through sources like a data warehouse, which is a type of data management system that supports business 
	intelligence activities (What is a Data Warehouse? n.d.). Once the data has been gathered, the data scientist places this in a data lake and begins the preparation of the data. 
	This is where data visualization tools are used in conjunction with statistical methods so that the data set’s attributes and patterns are discovered (Craig Stedman, 2021).</p>

<p>Afterward, the data is cleaned up, meaning any rogue data, errors, or null values are resolved. For the data set to be consistent, the data must be transformed through a process 
	called data transformation. However, this practice is not used by data scientists who want to analyse raw unfiltered data (Craig Stedman, 2021). In the fourth stage, only then 
	does the actual data mining commence. The data scientists then pick a suitable data mining technique for the algorithms to mine the data. In the case of machine learning systems, 
	they must be trained on a sample of data before they use the real data (Craig Stedman, 2021). The final stages are where the analysis and interpretation of the results are formed. 
	These results are used in the creation of analytical models where it influences business-related decisions and or commercial activities.Afterward, the data is cleaned up, meaning

<p>In conclusion, the challenges and implications that draw from data privacy in social media are important to society because of its relevance to people - Much of the world’s 
	population uses at least one form of social media. Because of this, knowing about data privacy in social media and what it entails, is an important step in protecting an 
	individual’s privacy online. With users joining social media networks every day, such awareness of previous data privacy breaches and data mining technologies is crucial. 
	Understanding the knowledge around data privacy in social media enables the prevention of data misuse and encourages the best practices for the safety of social media data online.</p>
