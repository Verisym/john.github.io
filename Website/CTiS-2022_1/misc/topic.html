<h1>Data Privacy in Social Media</h1>


</ul><h5><p>The page or area describing your chosen technology/topic and why it is significant and/or has important implications for society.<p></h5>
<p>Social media is a collection of websites and applications that allow users to share and create content. Since its spike in popularity in the early two-thousands, 
	it has changed the way we connect and communicate. This unprecedented growth has created gaps in online data privacy laws in countries around the world with 
	governments struggling to keep up. This allows multi-national companies to mismanage many peopleâ€™s data as they see fit. We plan to investigate the good side of 
	social media data mining and its misuse by companies who encourage users to overshare data and allow it to be exploited. As well as corporations magnifying the 
	issues of malware sharing and its contribution to identity theft.</p>

<p>Social media data is characterized as the information gathered from social networks that show how users share, view, or interact with each other using the social 
	networks' content, text messaging, or profile data. Social media data is a powerful way in which people can easily view what the public says or does (Kennedy & Moss, 2015). 
	Some examples of social media data include but are not limited to shares, likes, impressions, mentions, hashtags, URL clicks, followers, keywords, and comments. 
	These can be used to decide on various social strategy actions by the user. It has been used in research for the betterment of society, but also by large corporations 
	and government entities, that use data monitoring - Resulting in reduced user privacy (Kennedy & Moss, 2015). </p>
