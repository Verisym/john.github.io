<h1>Technology Choices</h1>


</ul><h4><p>How Choices affect Data Privacy in Social Media<p></h4>

<p>The choices that revolve around keeping your data safe online centre around the degree to which you choose to engage in
	social media or not. However, if the individual chooses to engage in social media, there are preventative measures 
	they could take in protecting their privacy. This could be by changing the default privacy settings on the social 
	media app or website to limit the number of information it shares. Or restricting the information you personally 
	post online. In general, you want to avoid sharing sensitive information, like your nearest school, current 
	workplace, or political positions or sensitive financial data to avoid cyber criminals stealing your identity 
	online (D. 2021). 
<p>Social media has created an environment where users are endlessly encouraged by all the various social media platforms 
	and all the different websites and apps that run through them to give up their personal data for the sake of 
	‘convenience’ through targeted advertising. This approach has led to millions of user's personal data being stored
	with only a handful of companies, the lack of competition in this sector ultimately leading to user data being at 
	risk as all of it is stored in the same place ‘Should social media data be misused, the risks to individual users'
	privacy and well-being can be substantial’ (Minin et al., 2021).   
<p>To combat this, users have a few things up their sleeve they can do. The first, and most obvious, being simply limiting
	how much personal information they put online. Choosing not to share their current or previous locations with 
	social media apps, not allowing these apps access to their private data on their phones, not uploading pictures 
	that may contain themselves or any information leading to their identity. However, after taking these precautions,
	you may be left without much reason to engage in social media at all, as their main purpose is to connect with 
	other people. It creates a great catch-22, if you engage too much on social media, you lose your anonymity. If you
	engage to little, you miss out on quite a large chunk of socialising and keeping up with your friends.  
<p>Most social media applications ask for use of cookies, user enabled tracking of their online footprint, in order to 
	create a profile and allow for more personalised recommendations. Multinational conglomerates linking and tracking 
	these same users over all social media platforms is what seems to be where many issues lie. Creating user profiles
	through data mining and then selling the data they have mined for profit to advertising companies. ‘Personalized 
	recommendation is crucial to help users find pertinent information. It often relies on a large collection of user 
	data, in particular users' online activity (e.g., tagging/rating/checking-in) on social media, to mine user 
	preference. However, releasing such user activity data makes users vulnerable to inference attacks, as private 
	data (e.g., gender) can often be inferred from the users' activity data’ (Yang, 2019).  
<p>The tools people have at their disposal to protect themselves online range in complexity and effectiveness and have 
	also expanded over the years. From simply not ticking a box that allows social media websites collect their 
	cookies, to buying expensive anti-virus software that stops all passage to any website that it deems dangerous or
	is trying to take information from behind the scenes, or a VPN (Virtual Private network) to simply add an extra 
	level of encryption between users' private data and everyone else. 
<p>To conclude, there are countless choices that have been created in order to keep your data private on social media. 
	From utilising ever advancing digital tools to keep your private information hidden when engaging in social media,
	to simply choosing to be mindful of what you post, every action and decision made whilst engaging with social media
	impacts how safe your data is. There is plenty that is in the control of the user, but not being mindful can 
	quickly give that data and power over to someone else.
