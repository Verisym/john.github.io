		<p id="left"><td>Social media is a collection of websites and applications that allow users to share and create content. Since its spike in popularity in the early two-thousands, it has changed the way we connect and communicate. This unprecedented growth has created gaps in online data privacy laws in countries around the world with governments struggling to keep up. This allows multi-national companies to mismanage many peopleâ€™s data as they see fit. We plan to investigate the good side of social media data mining and its misuse by companies who encourage users to overshare data and allow it to be exploited. As well as corporations magnifying the issues of malware sharing and its contribution to identity theft. We believe this is an important topic to research, because of its relevancy in this day and age, where a good number of people are using social media on a daily basis.</td></p>
