<h1>Technology Opportunities</h1>

</ul><h4><p>The page or area describing the opportunities presented by your chosen technology/topic.<p></h4>

<p>There are various opportunities social media data privacy entails, one of which is social media data mining. 
  It is the process of searching through extensive data sets for patterns and relationships that may be used to 
  solve business problems via data analysis (Craig Stedman, 2021). The procedures and devices customary in data 
  mining enable businesses to forecast future trends and make superior business decisions (Craig Stedman, 2021). 
  The process of data mining involves four key stages: gathering data, preparing data, mining the data, and data 
  analysing and interpreting (Craig Stedman, 2021). Social media data mining is critical in the research of social 
  behaviour, health, and technology. Moreover, social media data mining is utilized by businesses and organizations 
  for market research, which uncovers trends of what consumers are most interested in. In addition, social data is 
  used by government agencies in interventions regarding citizen well-being (Aušrinė, 2022).</p>

<p>Nowadays businesses are utilizing data mining’s many uses, one of which is in market and customer research. 
  With social networks' trajectory set into an upwards trend, there is a reason brands both big and small are 
  increasing their investments in social media. A recent survey was done by Sprout Social, which surveyed one 
  thousand US consumers and two-hundred and fifty business executives, to gain a better understanding of how they 
  use social media and the influence it has on an organisation (Sprout Social, 2021). Following a year of hastened 
  transformation, businesses are taking further commitments to social media by increasing investments and using 
  social data to inform opportunities outside of marketing. The survey discovered ninety-one percent of executives 
  expect their company's social media marketing budget to increase in three years, with the majority expecting an 
  increase of more than fifty percent. Eighty-five percent of executives believe social data will be a central 
  source of business intelligence for their company in the future. And seventy-eight percent of the consumers 
  surveyed are more swayed to buy from an item with a brand name. Finally, seventy-seven percent will choose a 
  specific brand over a competitor given their experience was positive with the brand on social media 
  (Sprout Social, 2021).</p>

<p>An example of social media data mining used in favour of society is in the research of human-nature 
  interactions - Or formally known as conservation culturomics. The field of conservation culturomics is new and 
  examines human-nature communications - In other words how humans interact in the digitized space 
  (Conservation Culturomics, n.d.). Interactions that are examined can manifest to gain an understanding of the 
  trends and patterns that underpin human interest and or principles (Conservation Culturomics, n.d.). 
  Minin et al., (2021) used social media data with the help of the content generated by users which includes images, 
  video, text, and audio to assess and evaluate human-nature interactions (Minin et al., 2021). Additionally, 
  their research carefully considered the traditional ethical principles and ensured their data management 
  procedures follow strict legal guidelines. This example displays the importance of social media data sources and 
  how it could be leveraged to allow for valuable insight into human-nature interactions. </p>

<p>There are several ways one could choose to analyze certain data. One of which uses a content analysis approach 
  which Minin et al., (2019) made use of. This approach revolves around the observation of a multitude of users’ 
  content across different social networks (Minin et al., 2021). As Minin et al., (2019) stated the use of social 
  media content in conservation science is scarce, with preceding studies opting for manual content analysis instead 
  (Minin et al., 2019). Nevertheless, the progress artificial intelligence is making is expeditious with its many 
  uses in the analysis and comprehension of social media content, both visual and textual (Minin et al., 2021). 
  For example, Artificial Intelligence can accurately and efficiently determine users’ emotions on social media, 
  recognize images of certain species of animals and verify landmarks (Minin et al., 2019). Deep learning is part 
  of the family of machine learning techniques that encompasses the use of artificial neural networks. Its design 
  is inspired by neurons in the human brain (Wikipedia contributors, 2022b). Once the machine is taught using a 
  large amount of input and desired output data samples – The more samples given, the greater the accuracy, 
  deep learning can accomplish tasks carried out without the need for human intervention (Minin et al., 2021). </p>

<p>To conclude, data privacy in social media has many opportunities for society. One of which is social media data 
  mining, which is used for the good by businesses, government agencies, and researchers. Businesses use social data 
  mining to learn more about their customers to improve their product or service. Government agencies use social data 
  mining to keep citizens safe. And researchers use this technology to find information regarding human-nature 
  interactions. Furthermore, the rapid progress of deep learning gives the possibility of an improved experience for 
  data mining. And because of its outstanding qualities, this technology proves to be effective in its use of visual 
  and textual analysis of social media content. These examples comprise the current opportunities data privacy in 
  social media entails, and the endless possibilities for the future.</p>
