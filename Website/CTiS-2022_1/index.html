<h1>Data Privacy in Social Media</h1>

<p>Due to the multiple advantageous research information data mining provides in social behaviour, health, as well as technology, 
social media data mining is morally neutral. However, it has drawbacks as a result of its abuse by certain organisations and 
cyber-criminal gangs. META, formerly known as ‘Facebook’, and many other megacorporation's have been exploiting and misusing people's 
data on their platform, prompting privacy concerns amongst its users. Furthermore, majority of individual's who access social media 
are oversharing their information. This comes as a significant issue as social media is publicly available to anyone, allowing 
cyber criminals to readily access and steal their information. These are the factors to consider when keeping one's online data 
privacy secured whilst being an avid user of social media.</p>

<p>Data privacy is a necessity that all social media companies should aim for. However, several large companies are abusing their 
power, which is causing distrust and uncertainty for its users. An example is Facebook, who were sued in March of 2018, for 
failing to protect users’ data in the Cambridge Analytica breach (Criddle, 2020). Cambridge Analytica board member, 
Stephen K. Bannon and Trump’s former Aide were found illegally acquiring data from around eighty-seven million Facebook 
users (Malyk, 2022). In the 2016 American presidential election, this data was used for Donald Trump’s campaign advertisements. 
The information allowed them to display specialized messages involving Trump to a number of American voters, on numerous 
online platforms (Wikipedia contributors, 2022).</p>

<p>Many risks are involved with data privacy, one being password hygiene. Many social media platforms use software when signing 
up to their platform. Software in which requires you to create a strong password, often using up to three different 
characters e.g., alphabetical, numerical and a symbol character. All of which are to prevent any potential malicious attacks. 
However, when a user signs up with a weak password, that user risks the potential brute force attack at account hacking. 
Another risk regarding social media data privacy is phishing scams. A social engineering technique that is becoming more and 
more common throughout social media. This form of attack usually involves a fake account, or even smarter, a hacked account 
of a friend where the attacker would interpret that person. The phishing artist would then send links which once clicked on, 
allow the hacker access into your account and any personal data you may have. Changing everything from the password, email, 
and phone number you once signed up with, meaning the account is no longer retrievable.</p>

<p>When creating a social media account, it is always good to be cautious of what you use for your password. A general rule of 
thumb is to always update your passwords regularly, never have repetitions with passwords for different logins and or social
media accounts. As well as the fewer factors that are often, overlooked. Those being password managers such as Azure and 
Google Cloud. Another measure of prevention is when browsing the web, use a VPN, such like NordVPN which you've probably 
seen advertised by multiple of your favourite tech youtuber. Using a VPN ensures your online browsing is secure without 
falling into the risk of possible popups that many fall for. A VPN also allows you to browse safely while using public 
Wi-Fi, which prevent third parties from accessing your device which pose as a possible threat to all your online data.</p>
